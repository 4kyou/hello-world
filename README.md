# hello-world
first repository on github

Hey there. What should i write next, idk. Just writing some stuff. Bla-bla-bla. Lol, like the motto of my life:"Just writing some stuff". Well, just don't read all the next part. I mean it, don't read. Stop reading. Just stop. Why don't you stop reading? What the hell? I'm not gonna write: i like you, rebbel. Because that would be stupid. And you're still reading...OMG! okay-okay, you won... you won nothing. BB
